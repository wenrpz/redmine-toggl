# Toggl API v8
[Toggl](http://www.toggl.com) is a time tracking tool.

[togglv8](/) is a Ruby Wrapper for [Toggl API v8](https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs). It is designed to mirror the Toggl API as closely as possible.

**Note:** Currently togglv8 only includes calls to [Toggl API](https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs/blob/master/toggl_api.md), not the [Reports API](https://github.com/toggl/toggl_api_docs/blob/master/reports.md)

# Usage
- See [test.rb](test.rb) and [atest.rb](atest.rb) for examples of calling the Toggl API with Ruby.
- See [API calls.md](API calls.md) for examples of calling the Toggl API with resty (like curl) on the command line.

# Acknowledgements

- Thanks to the Toggl team for exposing the API.
